## **Project Overview**
This project focuses on developing a customer service automation system that leverages sentiment analysis to generate context-appropriate responses based on customer queries. The system detects the tone and sentiment embedded in the customer’s input (formal, informal, friendly, or assertive) and automatically generates tailored replies, improving the quality and efficiency of customer service interactions.

## **Objectives**
1. **Tone Detection**: Implement a machine learning model capable of detecting the sentiment or tone of customer queries, including formal, informal, friendly, and assertive tones.
2. **Automated Response Generation**: Develop a response generation mechanism that formulates accurate and tone-matching replies based on detected sentiment and predefined customer service scenarios.
3. **Improved Customer Experience**: Enhance customer satisfaction by delivering responses that align with their emotional state, whether they require formal assistance, friendly support, or assertive resolutions.

## **Key Features**
1. **Sentiment Analysis**: The model analyzes the sentiment of the input query, determining whether the customer query is neutral, happy, frustrated, or demanding, and selects an appropriate tone of response.
2. **Tone-Matched Responses**: Once the sentiment is detected, the system generates customer service responses that reflect the detected tone—formal, informal, friendly, or assertive—ensuring the customer feels understood and adequately supported.
3. **Automated Response Templates**: A set of predefined templates allows the system to quickly deliver consistent and professional responses, reducing response time and enhancing scalability for high-volume customer service environments.
4. **Customizable Scenarios**: The model can be tailored to respond to various common customer service scenarios, such as delivery delays, product inquiries, or complaint handling, making it adaptable across industries.

## **Dataset**
The dataset consists of customer queries labeled with their corresponding tones (formal, informal, friendly, assertive), along with generated responses aligned with each tone. The dataset includes various customer service scenarios such as delivery inquiries, complaints, and general product information.

- **Columns**: 
   - `Query`: The input customer message.
   - `Tone`: The detected tone (formal, informal, friendly, assertive).
   - `Response`: The generated response matching the tone.

## **Technical Stack**
1. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Used for sentiment analysis and tone detection.
2. **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Supervised learning algorithms like Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or deep learning models like BERT for classifying tones and generating responses.
3. **Text Generation**: Template-based response generation or neural network approaches (e.g., GPT models) to create human-like replies.

## **Expected Outcomes**
- **Tone-appropriate responses**: The system will autonomously identify the sentiment behind a customer query and generate a response that matches the tone, enhancing customer interaction.
- **Reduced response time**: Automated responses will improve efficiency, enabling customer service teams to handle high volumes of inquiries faster.
- **Improved customer satisfaction**: By detecting and responding appropriately to customer emotions, the system aims to deliver more empathetic and personalized customer experiences.
